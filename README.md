# AIR-TRAFFIC-DELAY-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning (Random Forest) is a Python-based project that predicts flight delays for 11 busy origin airports in the United States using historical flight and weather data. The project leverages a Random Forest Regressor to forecast delays based on flight parameters and weather conditions.
