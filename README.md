# Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning (Random Forest)

## Project Overview
This project predicts flight delays for **11 busy origin airports in the United States** using historical flight and weather data. The model is built using a **Random Forest Regressor**, which forecasts delays based on flight parameters such as airline, departure/arrival times, origin/destination airports, and weather conditions.  

The goal is to help airlines, passengers, and logistics planners manage flight schedules effectively by predicting potential delays in advance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Prediction Output
The model predicts the **delay in minutes** for a given flight.

- **Positive value (e.g., 15)** â†’ Flight is delayed by 15 minutes.  
- **Zero (0)** â†’ Flight is on time or arrived early (negative values are also considered as 0).
